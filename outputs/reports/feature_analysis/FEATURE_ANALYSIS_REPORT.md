Generated on: 2025-07-21 02:12:52

## Analysis Overview
This report provides comprehensive analysis of feature importance across different methods and sensors.

## Key Findings

### Feature Importance Methods
1. **LightGBM Gain Importance**: Based on information gain from tree splits
2. **Permutation Importance**: Based on performance drop when features are shuffled
3. **Combined Ranking**: Normalized average of both methods

### Sensor Analysis
Review the sensor-wise importance analysis to understand which sensor modalities contribute most to behavior detection.

## Recommendations

### Feature Selection Strategy
1. **Remove Redundant Features**: Eliminate highly correlated features (>0.9 correlation)
2. **Focus on Top Features**: Prioritize features with high combined importance scores
3. **Sensor-Specific Analysis**: Consider sensor-wise feature engineering based on importance rankings
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA or similar techniques to remaining feature sets

### Model Improvement
1. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on important sensor combinations
2. **Interaction Features**: Explore interactions between high-importance features from different sensors
3. **Temporal Features**: Consider time-lagged versions of important features
4. **Ensemble Strategy**: Use different feature subsets for different models in ensemble

## Competition Context
- **Target**: Bronze medal (LB 0.60+)
- **Feature Strategy**: Balance between informativeness and computational efficiency
- **Next Phase**: Apply feature selection to improve model performance
